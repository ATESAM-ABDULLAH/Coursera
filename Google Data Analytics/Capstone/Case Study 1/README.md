# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, I'll explore real-world tasks and delve into data analysis to uncover insights that drive business decisions for the company.

## Scenario
In my role within the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, I've been tasked with understanding the behavior differences between annual members and casual riders. This analysis is pivotal in devising a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, aligning with Lily Moreno's strategic directive as the director of marketing.

## Characters and Teams
- **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program featuring over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, offering diverse bike types catering to various riders.
- **Lily Moreno**: Director of Marketing, overseeing campaign development and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team**: Responsible for guiding Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
- **Cyclistic Executive Team**: Decision-makers responsible for approving the recommended marketing program.

## About the Company
Cyclistic initiated its bike-share program in 2016, growing to over 5,800 bikes and 692 stations across Chicago. The previous marketing strategy focused on flexible pricing plans for casual riders and annual members.

## Ask
Guided by three key questions, I aim to understand the differences in bike usage between annual members and casual riders:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I've been specifically assigned to answer the first question, analyzing data to provide insights that will support our marketing strategy.
